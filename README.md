### *Mining of Refactoring Edits and Code Review Data*

![Data Mining Design](./images/mining_design.png)

#### Step 1. Mining of raw pull requests data
1. Search for Apache's non-archived Java repositories in [GitHub](https://github.com/search), by inputting *"user:apache language:java archived:false"* `We performed this search in August 2019`
1. Run the Python script [githubMinerPygithub](Step1/githubMinerPygithub.py)

The recovery of squashed commits from GitHub was built in lines 33-45, 126-130, 163-164. Aiming the strategy's effectiveness, we followed a few open pull requests up to the merge, such as the [apache/drill's pull request 1807](https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1807), then we (1) ran the RefactoringMiner to detect refactorings in the commits from open pull requests; (2) executed the recovery strategy after the pull requests merge; (3) ran the RefactoringMiner in the recovered commits; and (4) compared the outputs from steps (1) and (3)
   * No input
   * Output:
      * [./data/](data-mining-design/step-1/data) maintains repositories to pre-processing (needed to recover squashed and merged pull requests)
      * [./process/](data-mining-design/step-1/process) stores the *commits dataset* and *pull requests dataset* - both structured in line with the input format required to run the refactoring detection, so containing records for the following variables:
         * (commits dataset) repository's URL, pull request number, and commit SHA; for example, (*https://www.github.com/apache/dubbo-admin.git, 481,  77579afb66e1a78eb491f0a783705d40484de5a7*); and
         * (pull requests dataset) repository's URL, and pull request number; for example, (*https://www.github.com/apache/dubbo-admin.git, 479*)
      * [./results/](data-mining-design/step-1/results) registers the number of merged pull requests by repository

#### Step 2. Detection of refactoring edits
* Run the [Java code](data-mining-design/step-2/Main.java) for triggering the [RefactoringMiner](https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner) tool.
`Warning: This is a time-consuming task. If you have any problem, you should manually rerun the trigger and manage the output datasets.`
   * Input was preset as *commits dataset* and *pull requests dataset* (Step 1) - both available in [./data/](data-mining-design/step-2/data))
   * Output:
      * [./results/](data-mining-design/step-2/results) stores the following datasets:
         * [output_refactorings_at_apache_commits_level.csv](data-mining-design/step-2/results/output_refactorings_at_apache_commits_level.zip)
         * [output_refactorings_at_apache_prs_level.csv](data-mining-design/step-2/results/output_refactorings_at_apache_prs_level.zip)
      * The output datasets comprise these variables: repository's name, pull request number, commit(s) SHA, refactoring type(s), refactoring detail(s), and level; for example, (*apache/flink, 9595, 886419f12f60df803c9d757e381f201920a8061a, Rename Variable, table:Table to src:Table in method public testPartitionPrunning():void in class org.apache.flink.connectors.hive.HiveTableSourceTest, commit*). Level is a flag indicating the RefactoringMiner running level, that is, either commit level for squashed and merged pull requests or pull request level for non-squashed and merged pull requests.
   * Utils:
      * A Python script ([filesConcat](data-mining-design/step-2/filesConcat.py)) for concatenating the output datasets, resulting in *detected refactorings dataset* - [output_refactorings_at_apache.csv](data-mining-design/step-2/results/output_refactorings_at_apache.zip)

#### Step 3. Mining of raw code review data 
* Run the Python script [githubReviewMinerPygithub](data-mining-design/step-3/githubReviewMinerPygithub.py) for mining the code reviewing-related attributes listed below.

| Attribute            | Description                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| number               | Numerical identifier of a pull request          |
| title                | Title of a pull request                         |
| repository           | Repository's name of a pull request             |
| labels               | Labels associated with a pull request           |
| commits              | Number of subsequent commits in a pull request  |
| additions            | Number of added lines in a pull request         |
| deletions            | Number of deleted lines in a pull request       |
| file changes         | Number of file changes in a pull request        |
| creation date        | Date and time of a pull request creation        |
| merge date           | Date and time of a pull request merge           |
| reviewers            | Number of reviewers in a pull request           |
| review comments      | Number of review comments in a pull request     |
| non-review comments  | Number of non-review comments in a pull request |
| review comments text | The review comments of a pull request           |

`Specifically, our implementation meets this precondition: we mine only merged pull requests, comprising at least one review comment, since we investigated code reviewing-related aspects in the context of refactoring-inducing pull requests.`

   * Input was preset as *detected refactorings dataset* (Step 2) - available in [./data/](data-mining-design/step-3/data)) 
   * Output:
      * *Code review dataset* - [output_reviewing_apache.csv](data-mining-design/step-3/manual-inspection-of-rebasing/output/output_reviewing_apache.csv)
      * *Code review comments dataset* - [refactorings_at_apache_output_review_comments.csv](data-mining-design/step-3/results/refactorings_at_apache_output_review_comments.zip)
   * Utils:
      * A Python script ([datasetsOrganizer](data-mining-design/step-3/datasetsOrganizer.py)) for cleaning the output datasets (checking for mirrored repositories, duplicates, and unexpected faults such as zero reviewers), resulting in [output_apache_refactorings_review.csv](data-mining-design/step-3/results/output_apache_refactorings_review.csv) and [output_apache_refactorings_review_comments.csv](data-mining-design/step-3/results/output_apache_refactorings_review_comments.zip). 
      * A Python script ([githubMinerAuthoredData](data-mining-design/step-3/githubMinerAuthoredData.py)) for marking the initial commits in the complete refactorings dataset, resulting in [output_final_refactorings_at_apache.csv](data-mining-design/step-3/results/output_final_refactorings_at_apache.zip)
      * A Python script ([githubMinerCommitsData](data-mining-design/step-3/githubMinerCommitsData.py)) for mining the number of file changes, line additions, and line deletions in subsequent commits of our sample, resulting in an updated *code review dataset* [output_reviewing_at_apache.csv](data-mining-design/step-3/output/output_reviewing_at_apache.csv)
      * A Python script ([githubMinerParentsData](data-mining-design/step-3/githubMinerParentsData.py)) for mining the number of parents in subsequent commits of our sample, resulting in an updated *code review dataset* [output_reviewing_at_apache.csv](data-mining-design/step-3/output/output_reviewing_at_apache.csv)
      * A Python script ([githubMinerCheckingRebase](data-mining-design/step-3/githubMinerCheckingRebase.py)) for searching for commit merge in subsequent commits of our sample, resulting in an updated *code review dataset* [output_reviewing_at_apache.csv](data-mining-design/step-3/output/output_reviewing_at_apache.csv)
      
`After, we manually inspected pull requests, searching for rebasing. Accordingly, the code review dataset consists of pull requests that did not suffer rebase, merged by either merge pull request or squash and merge option.`

* Run the Python script [arl](study-one/step-1/arl.py) for running the FP-growth algorithm on the following code reviewing-related features.

| Feature                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| time to merge = merge date - creation date                                       |
| number of detected refactorings                                                  |
